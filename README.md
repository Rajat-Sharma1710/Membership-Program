# Membership Program – FirstClub

A Spring Boot backend system for a subscription-based **Membership Program** with tiered benefits, designed with a focus on extensibility, modularity, and clean abstractions.

---

## Problem Statement

Design a backend system for FirstClub that allows users to subscribe to membership plans with tiered benefits.

---

## Features Implemented

- Subscribe to a membership plan + tier combination (Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly × Silver / Gold / Platinum)
- Cancel an active subscription at any time
- Change membership plan (same tier, different billing cycle)
- Upgrade / downgrade membership tier
- Track current membership and expiry
- Pricing Catalogue — admin-configurable plan+tier combination prices
- Subscription history maintained per user

---

## Design Decisions & Abstractions

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `User` | Holds current active subscription + full subscription history |
| `Subscription` | Represents a user's active contract with startDate, endDate, status |
| `PricingCatalogue` | Maps every Plan+Tier combination to a configurable final price |
| `Order` | Maps every Order to user |

### Key Design Patterns Used

**1. State Pattern** — `ISubscriptionState` with `ActiveSubscriptionState`, `ExpiredSubscriptionState`, `CancelledSubscriptionState`
- Each state knows its valid transitions (e.g. you cannot cancel an already-expired subscription)
- `SubscriptionStateFactory` resolves the correct state at runtime — no if-else chains in services

**2. Factory Pattern** — `SubscriptionStateFactory` decouples state resolution from business logic

**3. Interface Segregation** — Separate interfaces for each concern:
- `IUserService` → subscribe, cancel, track
- `IPlanSubscriptionService` → change plan
- `ITierSubscriptionService` → upgrade/downgrade tier
- `IPriceCatalogueService` → manage pricing catalogue

## 💡 Assumptions

1. A user can select any plan + tier combination freely
2. Tier upgrade is allowed only when the user is not already at the highest tier (PLATINUM)
3. Subscription history is preserved — cancellation never deletes records
4. Price at time of subscription is stored on the Subscription for historical accuracy
5. There is no automatic downgrade rule for tiers
